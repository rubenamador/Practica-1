## How to work with this repo

Open this repo with your IDE. Install requirements into your environment. You can use: 
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python setup.py install`
3. `make init`
  
## Execute tests
`make tests`

## Working with GIT
We need to create 2 different branches: `master` and `develop` (you can use [this](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches))
- `master`: this will be the branch I want to evaluate.
- `develop`: use it to add all the code you develop

Everytime you want to pass code from develop to master you need to do a `pull request` and you need someone review your code. You can know more in [this](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) page.
